# BIS-classifier
Recreation of the Bispectral Index Scale, an algorithm used to monitor depth of anesthesia, using MATLAB

This project was developed in the "Diagnostic and self-regulation algorithms". To replicate the "BIS" algorithm the following methods were
used: ICA, filtering, wavelet decomposition, PCA/MDS and clustering. The best results were given by the hierarchical clustering - precision 88.4%, sensitivity - 77.6% and specificity - 95.3%.
